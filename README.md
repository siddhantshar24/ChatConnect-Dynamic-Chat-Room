NodeJS is used for making a project that works as a Chat Room application built using the help of Socket.io library. Socket.io helps in creating the connection between different chat windows involved/created in the application.

The application is used for texting among peers and people get notified everytime a new person joins the server for texting. Multiple users could be created using the application and they could send the texts among one another.


To start the project in your local, navigate to the project directory, and run:

### `node server.js`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in your browser.


Use the UI page to create a new chat window and connect with one another across the application. Messages sent across are shown with appropriate name provided during creation of a new user in the chat room.
To quit the chat one has to close the window and the chat connection is terminated afterwards.

Thank you so much.
